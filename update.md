## Personal Goals and updates
* Currently there are no goals which led to poor management of this repository.
* I assumed everyone had an idea on how to get into data-science and start their journey.
* But tbh, very few have an idea on what needs to be done and what all skills are required in order to leverage data and build machine learning models.
* Now on, every short term goal will be created as an `[ST]issue` in the repository and will be fixed with in 2 days.
* Long term goals will be tagged as `[LT]issue` and will be fixed with in 2 weeks.

*__Updates will be posted here and change of structure will be posted in the README.md file__*
