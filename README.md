# Data Science Bootcamp

Building a repository which will help a __Novice Data Science Enthusiast__, understand where to start from, and what decisions he/she need to make in order to __build a career in data science__. The Learning Path will be divided into __FOUR__ levels:

- __Level 0__
  * Mathematics - Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability
  * Databases - DDL, DML, DCL, TCL of SQL. Inner, Outer, Left, Right joins
  * Programming Languages - Conditional statements to File accessing in Python. Coding standards and folder structures are also covered.
  * Tools - Jupyter Notebooks, Excel
  
- __Level 1__
  - Statistics - Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Testing
  - Data Analysis - Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation, Data Understanding
  - Machine Learning - Log loss, Vectorisation, Math inside Machine Learning Techniques
    - Supervised - Classification, Regression, SVM
    - Unsupervised - Principle Component Analysis, Clustering
  - Model Evaluation - Regression and Classification Evaluation Metrics, Hyperparameters
  - Model Deployment - Docker, Flask API, Postman

- __Level 2__
  - Advanced Machine Learning - Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees
  - Deep Learning - Deep Neural Networks, Mathematics behind Forward and Back Propagation, Tensorflow/Keras
  - Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks, Residual Networks, Image Processing, Object Detection, Video Processing
  - Time Series - LSTM Models, GRU Models, Natural Language Processing, Forecasting.
  - Reinforcement Learning - Markov Models, Tree Search Methods, Enviroments, and Training agents.

- __Level 3__
  - Data Science Resources - Git Repositories, Social Networks, Communities
  - Shifting to Data Science - Transitional Discomfort, Resume Templates, Cracking Interviews
  - Keeping up with the Technology - Learner's mindset, Reading Research Papers, Finding good blogs about Data Science.

__System Requirements__
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
* [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
* [Microsoft Excel](https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx)

Every section will contain notebooks with day numbers. Reading through the notebook will not only give you an idea about the day's topic, but also will run a code which will implement what we've just learnt. Each module will have a DIY assignment along with an appropriate folder structure. After finishing the assignments and projects along the way, you will gain immense amount of knowledge and deep intuitions on data science concepts.
