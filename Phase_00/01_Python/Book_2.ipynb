    "- __Interpreted:__ All the implementations are executed directly without requirement for compilation.\n",
    "- __Object-Oriented:__ Presence of Classes and Objects which will increase code re-usability and cleanliness. \n",
    "- __High Level Programming:__ Language is very simple and understandable for programmer.\n",
    "- __Dynamic Semantics:__ Having natural language commands which perform operations. `and`, `or`, `not` keywords are few examples for this.\n",
